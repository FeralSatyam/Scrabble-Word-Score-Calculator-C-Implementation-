# Scrabble-Word-Score-Calculator-C-Implementation-
This C program simulates a Scrabble-style word game where two players enter words, and the program calculates their scores based on letter values. The player with the higher score wins.

Features:
âœ… User Input Validation â€“ Ensures players enter valid words.
âœ… Automatic Uppercase Conversion â€“ Converts words to uppercase for uniform scoring.
âœ… Scrabble Score Calculation â€“ Uses the official Scrabble letter values.
âœ… Winner Determination â€“ Compares scores and announces the winner.

How It Works:
1.Takes input from two players (words).
2.Converts all letters to uppercase (to match Scrabble values).
3. Assigns points based on letter values using an array.
4. Compares scores to determine the winner.
5. Displays the result: Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or a Tie.

What I Learned:
ðŸ“Œ Using arrays for letter scoring.
ðŸ“Œ Manipulating strings in C with toupper() and strlen().
ðŸ“Œ Applying conditionals to determine the winner.
